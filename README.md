My journey into IT began in childhood, watching hacker movies and dreaming of "talking" to computers and understanding their inner workings. 
Today, I specialize in building robust server-side applications using Spring Boot and managing data with PostgreSQL and MySQL.
I am currently expanding my skill set, proactively moving towards becoming a versatile Full-stack Developer. I am actively learning front-end technologies (HTML/CSS), solving practical developing personal projects.
My goal is versatility. I believe that understanding the entire tech stack allows for the creation of higher-quality, more cohesive products. I am always open to new knowledge and ready for challenges.

Skills: 
* Java 11+;
* PostgreSQL/MySQL;
* Spring Framework;
* Docker;
* Logging;
* Unit-tests;
